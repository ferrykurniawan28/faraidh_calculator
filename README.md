## 🧮 Islamic Inheritance Rules Implementation

### Supported Heir Types
- **Spouses**: Husband (Suami), Wife (Istri)
- **Parents**: Father (Ayah), Mother (Ibu)
- **Children**: Son (Anak Laki-laki), Daughter (Anak Perempuan)
- **Siblings**: Brother (Saudara Laki-laki), Sister (Saudara Perempuan)
- **Grandparents**: Grandfather (Kakek), Grandmother (Nenek)
- **Grandchildren**: Grandson (Cucu Laki-laki), Granddaughter (Cucu Perempuan)
- **Other**: For additional heir types

### Inheritance Calculation Logic
The application implements authentic Islamic inheritance rules:

1. **Fixed Shares (Fara'id)**: Certain heirs receive fixed portions
   - Husband: 1/4 (with children) or 1/2 (without children)
   - Wife: 1/8 (with children) or 1/4 (without children)
   - Parents: 1/6 each (with children) or mother 1/3 (without children)

2. **Residual Inheritance ('Asabah)**: Male heirs typically receive residual amounts
3. **Gender-based Distribution**: Male heirs often receive twice the share of female heirs
4. **Hierarchical Precedence**: Closer relatives have precedence over distant ones
5. **Automatic Normalization**: Adjusts shares if total exceeds 100%

### Validation Rules
- Cannot have both husband and wife in the same calculation
- Must have at least one heir and one asset
- Heir names must be unique
- Asset values must be positive numbers
- Real-time validation with user-friendly error messages

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Design Principles
- **Clean and Minimal**: Focused on functionality without clutter
- **Web-Native Feel**: Designed specifically for web browsers
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and intuitive navigation
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)

### Layout Types
- **Desktop Layout**: Two-column layout with forms on left, chart on right
- **Tablet Layout**: Stacked layout with responsive chart sizing
- **Mobile Layout**: Single-column layout optimized for touch interaction

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Color**: Green (representing growth and prosperity)
- **Material Design 3**: Modern color system with dynamic theming
- **Semantic Colors**: Orange for warnings, red for errors, blue for information, green for success

### Interactive Elements
- **Hero Section**: Statistics cards showing heirs count, total assets, and calculation status
- **Responsive Cards**: Clean white cards with subtle shadows
- **Action Buttons**: Clear call-to-action buttons with proper visual hierarchy

## 🌐 Internationalization

### Supported Languages
- **English**: Default language with comprehensive translations
- **Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)**: Complete translation including cultural adaptations

### Translation Coverage
- `app_en.arb`: English translations (130+ strings)
- `app_id.arb`: Indonesian translations (130+ strings)

### Localized Elements
- **UI Components**: All buttons, labels, titles, and messages
- **Data Types**: Heir types, asset types with culturally appropriate names
- **Validation Messages**: Error messages and warnings
- **Educational Content**: Disclaimers and help text
- **Settings**: Language selection interface

### Language Features
- **Dynamic Switching**: Change language in settings without restart
- **Persistent Storage**: Language preference saved using SharedPreferences
- **Context-aware Translation**: Models provide localized display names based on current locale
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful fallback to default language if translation missing

## 📱 State Management

### BLoC Pattern Architecture
The application uses the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for predictable state management:

#### InheritanceBloc
- **Purpose**: Manages heir and asset data, handles inheritance calculations
- **Events**: AddHeir, RemoveHeir, AddAsset, RemoveAsset, CalculateInheritance, Reset
- **State**: InheritanceState with heirs list, assets list, calculation status, total values
- **Benefits**: Real-time updates, automatic recalculation, validation

#### LanguageBloc
- **Purpose**: Manages language preferences and switching
- **Events**: LoadLanguage, ChangeLanguage
- **State**: LanguageState with current locale
- **Persistence**: Uses SharedPreferences for storing user preference
- **Benefits**: Seamless language switching, persistent settings

### State Flow
1. User interactions trigger events
2. BLoCs process events and emit new states
3. UI rebuilds automatically based on state changes
4. Persistent data is saved locally when needed

## 🔧 Technical Stack

### Framework & Platform
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework (optimized for web)
- **Dart**: Programming language with null safety
- **Web Target**: Chrome browser optimized deployment
